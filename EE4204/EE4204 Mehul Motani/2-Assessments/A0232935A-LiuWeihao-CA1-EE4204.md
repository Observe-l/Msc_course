## Q1

1. Time delay 
2. Packet loss 
3. Bandwidth
4. Throughput

## Q2

**a)**

**Layer 1 - Physical:**

This layer deals with physical characteristics of transmission medium.

**Layer 2 - Data link:**

This layer provides access to the networking media and physical transmission across the media.

Besides, it provides reliable transit of data across a physical link. (hop-by-hop)

**Layer 3 - Network:**

This layer defined end-to-end delivery of packets. It also defines how routing works and how routes are learned so that the packets can be delivered.

**Layer 4 - Transport**

This layer regulates information flow to ensure end-to-end connectivity between host applications reliably and accurately.

**Layer 5 - Session**

This layer defines how to start, control and end conversations (called sessions) between applications. This includes the control and management of multiple bidirectional messages using dialogue control.

**Layer 6 - Presentation**

This layer ensures that the information that the application layer of one system sends out is readable by the application layer of another system.

**Layer 7 - Application**

This layer provides network services to the user's applications.

**b)**

TCP/IP stack contain **data link layer**, **network layer**, **transport layer** and **application layer**.

## Q3

**Pros:**



**Cons:**





## Q4

**a) Packet Switching**

Compare with circuit switching, packet switching allows more users to use network.

**b) End-to-End principle**
