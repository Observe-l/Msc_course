### Q1

* IPv4 only has 32-bit address, the address space soon to be completely allocated. But IPv6 has 128 bits address.
* Header format helps speed processing/forwarding
* Header changes to facilitate QoS

### Q2

1. Link-State approach
   - This is a global information, all routers have complete topology, link cost info.
   - It's a static protocol, routes changes slowly

2. Distance Vector
   - It's a decentralized information, router knows physically-connected neighbors, link costs to neighbors.
   - Iterative process of computation, exchange of info with neighbors.
