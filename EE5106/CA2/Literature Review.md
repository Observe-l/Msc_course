## 1. Literature Review

With the advancing of industrialization and the advent of the information age, intelligent robots play an increasingly important role in intelligent manufacturing, intelligent transportation system, the Internet of things, medical health and intelligent services. 

From the perspective of the application environment, intelligent robots can be divided into industrial robots, service robots and specialized robots.

### 1.1 Industrial robot

Industrial robots are an important automation equipment of modern manufacturing industry, which integrate the advanced technology of multi-disciplinary, such as machinery, electronics, control, computer, sensor, artificial intelligence, etc.

They are widely used in a number of industrial production activities, such as spraying, welding, handling, etc., and have a great role in these sectors. Recently, the robotic technology is developing towards high precision, high intelligence. Robot calibration technology has a great significance to improve the accuracy of robot.

At present, one of the development directions of industrial robots is focused on how to improve positioning accuracy, which has also become one of the key technologies for the practical application of off-line programming methods in advanced robotic manufacturing systems. The pose error of the robot can be greatly reduced by calibration, the absolute accuracy of the robot can be improved for the level of repeat accuracy. 

There are many calibration algorithms, such as 1) Least Squares Algorithm; 2) Levenberg-Marquardt Algorithm; 3) Extended Kalman and Particle Filter Algorithm; 4) Maximum Likelihood Estimation Algorithm. However, **non-parametric calibration** uses **intelligent algorithms** to solve the problem of nonlinear calibration. Non-parametric calibration gives a new research idea for researchers, which has a close relationship with artificial intelligence.

### 1.2 Service robot

According to the definition of International Federation of Robotics (IFR), service robot is a “robot that performs useful tasks for humans or equipment excluding industrial automation applications”.

For example, the servant robots, such as intelligent sweeping robots and window cleaning robots, can work as human assistants to do housework. They can also provide navigation services, automatically making path planning and avoiding obstacles. Other kinds of service robots, like family socialization robots, companion robots, mobile assistant robots and pet exercising robots, are able to interact with people, as well as completing delivering missions, caring for the elderly and children, reminding about events and patrolling houses. 

Rapidly improving technologies become smarter, more powerful, smaller, lighter and cheaper. These include sensors, cameras, speech processing, image processing, biometrics, analytics, mobile and cloud technologies, geo-tagging and more, and they are increasingly powered by **artificial intelligence (AI).**

### 1.3 Specialized robots

Specialized robots are robots that apply to special environments. They can assist in completing tasks in dangerous and harsh environment or tasks requiring high precision. 

For example, the medical robots provide advanced solutions to surgical treatment and rehabilitation which is significant for reducing the difficulty of surgery and treatment, and shortening the recovery time, such robots include master-slave surgical robot, orthopedics robot, capsule endoscopy robot, rehabilitation robot, intelligent prostheses, aged service robot and nursing robot. 

The military robots, including reconnaissance robots, battlefield robots, minesweeper robots and military UAVs, have a long history and have already been put into the battlefield, which make contributions to material transportation, search and exploration, anti-terrorist rescue and military attack. The anti-terrorist and rescue robots consist of EOD robots, fire-fighting robots, life detection and rescue robots, etc. 

Concerning with the exploration cause, space robots, underwater robots, and pipeline robots have presented impressive performance. In addition, there are some robots for scientific researches and cutting-edge applications, including nanorobot, bionic robots, swarm robots, etc.
